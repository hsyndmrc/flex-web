          <h3>About Us</h3>
          <p>
            Escape from Tarkov is a hardcore and realistic online first-person
            action RPG/Simulator with MMO features and a story-driven
            walkthrough. With each passing day the situation in the Norvinsk
            region grows more and more complicated. Incessant warfare in Tarkov
            has sparked massive panic; the local population has fled the city,
            but those who stayed are looking to improve their fortunes at the
            expense of others.
          </p>
          <p class="second-art-par">
            The players will have to experience living in the skin of one of the
            mercenaries who survived the initial stage of the Tarkov conflict.
            After choosing one of the sides – USEC or BEAR – the player’s
            character starts to make his way out of the city. Tarkov is sealed
            off by UN and Russian military, supply chains are cut, communication
            with operational command is lost, and in these conditions everyone
            has to make his own choices of what to do and how to get out of the
            chaos-ridden metropolis.

          <h3>Tarkov city, Norvinsk region. Present time.</h3>
          <p>
            The events of the Escape from Tarkov take place in the fictional
            Norvinsk's region Special Economic Zone that became a gateway
            between Russia and Europe. Preferential conditions for large
            international companies, however, have not only attracted
            law-abiding businesses, but corporations of dubious intent as well.
